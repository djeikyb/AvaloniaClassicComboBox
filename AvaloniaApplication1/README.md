This is a [combo-box][combo-box].  
It combines the idea of a text input,  
with the idea of a pull-down button.  

This is a combo-box.  
Because Avalonia doesn't have one.  
The control named "ComboBox" is close.  
But without [IsEditable][not-editable], it's just a [pull-down button][pull-down-button].  

This is a combo-box.  
It's not a good one.  
And it's not generic; strings or bust!  
You're probably better off using [AutoCompleteBox][auto-complete-box].
